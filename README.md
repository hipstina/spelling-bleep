### **Description** 

**Spelling Bleep** is my take on the popular [NYT Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee)* game. As many puzzlers know, the NYT deems certain words too 'offensive' to permit in Spelling Bee. That is where **Spelling Bleep** comes in. Spelling Bleep allows and even rewards players for using foul language. In Spelling Bleep, high-scoring words like 'boobies' or 'goddamn' are fair game!

The points breakdown in Spelling Bleep: 
  + 4-letter words get 1 pt 
  + words over 4 letters are awarded 1 pt per letter
  + pangrams are worth 7 extra points 
  + bleep words are worth 10 extra points
  
Players only need to achieve 69% of the maximum possible points to reach genius rank. 

**The [NYT Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) is a 7-letter word puzzle. The objective of the game is to spell as many words as possible. The catch is that words must use the center letter and be at least 4 letters long.*
