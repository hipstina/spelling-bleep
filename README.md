### **Description** 
*The [NYT Times Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) is a 7-letter word puzzle. The objective of the game is to spell as many words as possible. The catch is that words must use the center letter and must be at least 4 letters long.*

**Spelling Bleep** is my take on the popular NYT Spelling Bee game. However, the NYT deems certain words too 'offensive' to permit in the game. That is where Spelling Bleep comes in. Spelling Bleep allows and even rewards players for using foul language. In Spelling Bleep, high-scoring words like 'boobies' or 'goddamn' are fair game!

The points breakdown in Spelling Bleep: 
  + 4-letter words get 1 pt 
  + words over 4 letters are awarded 1 pt per letter
  + pangrams are worth 7 extra points 
  + bleep words are worth 10 extra points
  
Lastly, players only need to achieve 69% of the maximum possible points to achieve genius rank.
